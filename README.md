### 3D-renderingCpp


Rendering with pure cpp. Using windows.h as a window library.
* All steps of the rendering pipeline are done serially - projection, depth testing, depth buffering, raterization/painting.
* It is very slow...

The sample is generating a spinning cube at about an average maximum limit of 20 fps.
